# A<sup>3</sup>CLNN: Spatial, Spectral and Multiscale Attention ConvLSTM Neural Network for Multisource Remote Sensing Data Classification

# Abstract:

The problem of effectively exploiting the information multiple data sources has become a relevant but challenging research topic in remote sensing. In this article, we propose a new approach to exploit the complementarity of two data sources: hyperspectral images (HSIs) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Specifically, we develop a new dual-channel spatial, spectral and multiscale attention convolutional long short-term memory neural network (called dual-channel A<sup>3</sup>CLNN) for feature extraction and classification of multisource remote sensing data. Spatial, spectral, and multiscale attention mechanisms are first designed for HSI and LiDAR data in order to learn spectral- and spatial-enhanced feature representations and to represent multiscale information for different classes. In the designed fusion network, a novel composite attention learning mechanism (combined with a three-level fusion strategy) is used to fully integrate the features in these two data sources. Finally, inspired by the idea of transfer learning, a novel stepwise training strategy is designed to yield a final classification result. Our experimental results, conducted on several multisource remote sensing data sets, demonstrate that the newly proposed dual-channel A3 CLNN exhibits better feature representation ability (leading to more competitive classification performance) than other state-of-the-art methods.
